**The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. The game has a limited number of incorrect guesses, after which the player loses.
****
Here's a detailed explanation with key points:

1. Objective of the Game
The goal is to guess the hidden word one letter at a time before the allowed number of incorrect guesses is exhausted.
If the player guesses the word correctly, they win.
If they exceed the maximum number of incorrect guesses, they lose.
2. Key Components of Hangman Game
Word to Guess
A random word is selected from a predefined list of words.
This word is kept hidden from the player, represented by underscores (_) for each letter.
Guesses
The player inputs a single letter as their guess.
The guess can either be correct (if the letter is in the word) or incorrect (if it's not).
Guessed Letters
A record of previously guessed letters is maintained to ensure the player doesn’t repeat guesses.
Incorrect Guesses
For each incorrect guess, the player loses one chance.
The total number of incorrect guesses allowed is limited (e.g., 6).
Game States
The game can end in two ways:
Win: The player successfully guesses the word.
Lose: The player uses all allowed guesses without guessing the word.
